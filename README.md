### üåê **Project 1: Network Recon Tool**  

#### **Objective**  
- **Network Interface Discovery**: Identify and list network interfaces, their IP addresses, subnet masks, and associated network ranges.  
- **Active Device Scanning**: Perform ARP scans to detect active devices and retrieve their IP and MAC addresses.  
- **IP Address Status Check**: Verify if specific IP addresses are active on the network and obtain their MAC addresses.  
- **Network Topology Visualization**: Generate graphical representations of network topology as HTML reports.  
- **User Interaction**: Provide an interactive tool for inputting networks to scan and IP addresses to check.  

#### **Tools Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:  
  - Scapy: Used for crafting and sending ARP packets.  
  - ipaddress: For validating and processing IP/network ranges.  
  - subprocess: Runs system commands like `ifconfig` to retrieve network interface details.  
  - NetworkX: Creates and manipulates network graphs.  
  - Matplotlib: Generates graphical network topology images.  
- **File Output**: HTML and PNG files for storing network topology visualizations.  

#### **Methodology**  
1. **Network Interface Discovery**:  
   - Extract network interface details using the `ifconfig` command.  
   - Parse output to retrieve IP addresses and subnet masks, converting them to CIDR notation.  
2. **Active Device Scanning**:  
   - Perform ARP scans to identify active devices and their IP/MAC addresses.  
3. **IP Address Status Check**:  
   - Use ARP requests to verify specific IP activity and retrieve MAC addresses.  
4. **Network Topology Visualization**:  
   - Represent the scanned network graphically using NetworkX and Matplotlib.  
   - Embed the generated topology in an HTML report.  
5. **User Interaction**:  
   - Allow users to dynamically select networks for scanning and specify IP addresses for checks.  

#### **Outcome**  
- **Comprehensive Network Scan Tool**: Effectively identifies active devices and collects relevant details.  
- **Enhanced Network Visibility**: Provides graphical topology visualizations for better understanding.  
- **Interactive Experience**: Real-time results with user-friendly input options.  
- **Scalable and Modular Design**: Functions are self-contained and easily customizable.

  - JSON: Store and parse vulnerability data and history records.  

#### **Methodology**  
1. **Data Acquisition**:  
   - Download CVE data from NVD feeds and retrieve Shodan results for user-specified IPs.  
2. **Data Processing**:  
   - Parse CVE data for details like IDs, descriptions, severity, and scores.  
   - Map Shodan results to NVD data for comprehensive reports.  
3. **Visualization and Analysis**:  
   - Generate interactive charts to illustrate vulnerability distribution and severity.  
   - Display results using Streamlit for seamless interaction.
